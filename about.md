I'm Jędrzej Michalczyk, an engineer interested in mathematics, embedded systems, and software development.

This blog is a place for technical notes — things I've worked through and want to keep a clear record of. Topics range from numerical methods and linear algebra to low-level programming and toolchain setup.
